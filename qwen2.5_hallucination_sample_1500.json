The effective speed of the boat when moving downstream is the sum of the speed of the boat in still water and the speed of the current.\n\nSpeed of the boat in still water = 20 kmph\nSpeed of the current = 4 kmph\n\nEffective speed downstream = Speed of the boat in still water + Speed of the current\nEffective speed downstream = 20 kmph + 4 kmph = 24 kmph\n\nNow, we need to convert the effective speed from kmph to m/s to match the distance given in meters.\n\n1 km = 1000 meters\n1 hour = 3600 seconds\n\nSo, to convert kmph to m/s, we use the following conversion factor:\n\n1 kmph = 1000/3600 m/s = 5/18 m/s\n\nEffective speed downstream in m/s = 24 kmph * (5/18) m/s per kmph =",

We need to find out how many years it will take for the total value of the investment plus interest to increase to $48000.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the interest rate X. We know that the total value of the investment plus interest at the end of 10 years is $24000. The initial investment is $6000, so the interest earned over 10 years is $24000 - $6000 = $18000.\n\nThe formula for compound interest is:\n\nA = P(1 + r)^n\n\nWhere:\nA = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest\nP = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)\nr = the annual interest rate (decimal)\nn = the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for\n\nWe know that A = $24000, P = $6000, and n = 10.

Since the ratio of a to b is 4:1, we can say that the volume of liquid a is 4V/5 and the volume of liquid b is V/5.\n\nWhen 10 liters of the mixture is replaced with liquid b, the new ratio of a to b becomes 2:3. Let's denote the new volume of liquid a as (4V/5) - 10 and the new volume of liquid b as (V/5) + 10.\n\nAccording to the new ratio, we have:\n\n(4V/5 - 10) / ((V/5) + 10) = 2/3\n\nCross-multiplying gives us:\n\n3(4V/5 - 10) = 2((V/5) + 10)\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\n12V/5 - 30 = 2V/5 + 20\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n12V/5 - 2V/5 = 20 + 30\n\n10V",

So, we can write the equation: (600 - C) = (580 - C) + 0.05(C).\n\n6. Simplifying the equation, we get: 600 - C = 580 - C + 0.05C.\n\n7. Further simplifying, we get: 600 - 580 = 0.05C.\n\n8.

Let's try factoring first:\n\nWe need two numbers that multiply to -132 and add up to 1 (since x + x^2 = x(1 + x)). The numbers that satisfy these conditions are 11 and -12, because 11 * -12 = -132 and 11 + (-12) = -1.\n\nSo we can write:\n\n(x - 11)(x + 12) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for x:\n\nx - 11 = 0 or x + 12 = 0\n\nSolving for x in each case:\n\nx = 11 or x = -12\n\nSince we are looking",
